# flatbuffer_direct architecture

`flatbuffer_direct` keeps its public CLI and Python API in `onnx2tf.onnx2tf`.
New implementation work belongs behind the internal contracts in
`onnx2tf.tflite_builder.core`; those contracts must not be exported as public
API.

## Pipeline

The required stage order is:

1. normalize the public arguments into `ConversionRequest` and `ArtifactPlan`;
2. preprocess ONNX;
3. create one `ConversionSession`, `GraphIndex`, and `LayoutState`;
4. execute registered passes in `PassPhase` order;
5. lower operators into ModelIR;
6. validate ModelIR invariants;
7. invoke only exporters selected by `ArtifactPlan`;
8. adapt `ConversionResult` back to the legacy return dictionary.

A pass has a stable ID, phase, priority, maximum iteration count, and explicit
`changed` result. Repeating passes must use a graph fingerprint so a cycle
terminates deterministically. Risky rewrites use the transactional mode and
must leave the graph unchanged when invariant validation fails.

Operator additions keep capability validation and lowering in the same
op-family module. Do not add model-name checks. A model-specific failure should
be reduced to a semantic graph pattern with explicit guards and a focused ONNX
fixture generated with `onnx.helper`.

## Dependency boundaries

Default TFLite conversion and ONNX/TFLite accuracy checking must import neither
TensorFlow nor tf-keras. TensorFlow is allowed only after the user explicitly
requests a TensorFlow-family artifact. PyTorch remains an optional dependency
and is loaded only for a requested PyTorch-family artifact.

No new third-party dependency may be added for this refactor. Use `uv sync` for
the core profile, `uv sync --extra torch` for PyTorch exports, and
`uv sync --extra tensorflow` for optional TensorFlow exports.

PyTorch-family example-input construction and export metadata persistence live
in `pytorch_export_support.py`; shared export exceptions live in
`pytorch_export_errors.py`. These modules are bounded internal contracts and
must not import TensorFlow. Image trace data is resized with the existing
PyTorch dependency so TorchScript, Dynamo ONNX, and ExportedProgram generation
does not require the TensorFlow optional extra.

## Regression workflow

Create the local corpus inventory without copying model files into Git:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_corpus_manifest \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_corpus.json
```

Run inference sequentially by node tier. For example, Tier 1 is:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_bulk_runner \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_bulk_report_tier1 \
  --min_nodes 50 --max_nodes 199 --tflite_only --root_only
```

The number `2,000` in the validation policy refers to the number of ONNX graph
nodes (operations) in a model. It is not a source-file line limit. Source and
test modules may be split when that improves ownership or reviewability, but
there is no 2,000-line structural gate.

The active improvement and regression scope is every root model in Tier 0
through Tier 4, including models whose baseline classification is a conversion
error, accuracy failure, or missing report. Recorded timeout models are kept
for provenance but excluded from subsequent runs. Tier 5 is a historical
baseline only and must not be run as part of ongoing refactoring.
Do not introduce a process pool or parallel model runner. Every successful
baseline model must remain successful; known Tier 0-4 failures are improvement
targets and must retain a normalized signature until they improve. Accuracy
reports retain their existing stricter judgement and every comparable float
output must remain below a maximum absolute error of `1e-1`.

Use the managed Tier 0-4 profile for a full active regression:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_bulk_runner \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_active_regression \
  --regression_profile docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_active_tier0_4.json \
  --tflite_only
```

The profile fixes root-only discovery, the 1–1,999 node range, all 420 managed
historical model records, and inference concurrency of one. Models classified
as `timeout` in the current managed baseline remain recorded for provenance but
are automatically excluded from subsequent runs. The active run therefore
contains 394 models: 334 expected passes and 60 expected non-passes, excluding
26 recorded timeouts. Tier 5 models cannot be added because the profile loader
rejects tiers above 4 and node ranges above 1,999.

### Recorded Tier 0 baseline

The recursive Tier 0 corpus at commit `c4f3b7a` contains 190 models. Its
managed result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier0_c4f3b7a.json`:
137 passed, 10 conversion errors, 1 timeout, 6 accuracy failures, and 36
missing accuracy reports. The median per-model duration was 2.165 seconds.
Failures are fixed by normalized signature; local run artifacts remain outside Git.

The formal root-only Tier 0 gate at commit `32c3277` contains 120 readable
models; the planned 121st entry has no readable node count. The managed result
is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier0_root_32c3277.json`: 96 passed, 9
conversion errors, 4 accuracy failures, 11 missing reports, and no timeouts.
Its median duration was 2.281 seconds. All 120 classifications and normalized
signatures match the same models in the recursive baseline.

The root-only Tier 1 gate at commit `a1fd301` contains 86 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier1_root_a1fd301.json`: 57
passed, 5 conversion errors, 13 accuracy failures, 11 missing reports, and
no timeouts. Median and maximum durations were 4.046 and 79.296 seconds.

The root-only Tier 2 gate at commit `ad1d508` contains 113 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier2_root_ad1d508.json`: 80
passed, 4 conversion errors, 3 timeouts, 6 accuracy failures, and 20 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 7.124 and 120.360 seconds.

The root-only Tier 3 gate at commit `c838b42` contains 71 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier3_root_c838b42.json`: 22
passed, 15 conversion errors, 17 timeouts, 1 accuracy failure, and 16 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 17.248 and 120.662 seconds.

The root-only Tier 4 gate at commit `0a8ee88` contains 30 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier4_root_0a8ee88.json`: 12
passed, 7 conversion errors, 4 timeouts, 2 accuracy failures, and 5 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 28.100 and 121.826 seconds. All 12
passing models remained below the required `1e-1` maximum absolute error.

The root-only Tier 5 gate at commit `95aa61b` contains 34 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier5_root_95aa61b.json`: 6
passed, 4 conversion errors, 10 timeouts, 2 accuracy failures, and 12 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 51.621 and 123.486 seconds. All 6
passing models remained below the required `1e-1` maximum absolute error; the
largest passing error was `2.3543834686279297e-4`.

The Tier 4 result is part of the active improvement gate. The Tier 5 result is
retained only as historical evidence; do not rerun Tier 5 or use its failed
models as current improvement gates.

## Remaining refactoring order

1. Improve Tier 0-4 layout, transpose, broadcast, shape reconciliation, and
   fusion failures using semantic passes and focused ONNX fixtures.
2. Continue moving validation, capability selection, and lowering into
   op-family modules while preserving the current public API and artifacts.
3. Complete quantization, split/crop, custom/pseudo op, report, and requested-
   artifact-only regression coverage on the validated ModelIR contract.
4. Complete the shared PyTorch/TorchScript/Dynamo ONNX/ExportedProgram
   canonicalization and emitter separation.
5. Measure warm-run conversion time and peak RSS on the active Tier 0-4 set,
   then document improvements and remaining normalized failures.
