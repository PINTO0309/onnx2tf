# flatbuffer_direct architecture

`flatbuffer_direct` keeps its public CLI and Python API in `onnx2tf.onnx2tf`.
New implementation work belongs behind the internal contracts in
`onnx2tf.tflite_builder.core`; those contracts must not be exported as public
API.

## Pipeline

The required stage order is:

1. normalize the public arguments into `ConversionRequest` and `ArtifactPlan`;
2. preprocess ONNX;
3. create one `ConversionSession`, `GraphIndex`, and `LayoutState`;
4. execute registered passes in `PassPhase` order;
5. lower operators into ModelIR;
6. validate ModelIR invariants;
7. invoke only exporters selected by `ArtifactPlan`;
8. adapt `ConversionResult` back to the legacy return dictionary.

A pass has a stable ID, phase, priority, maximum iteration count, and explicit
`changed` result. Repeating passes must use a graph fingerprint so a cycle
terminates deterministically. Risky rewrites use the transactional mode and
must leave the graph unchanged when invariant validation fails.

Operator additions keep capability validation and lowering in the same
op-family module. Do not add model-name checks. A model-specific failure should
be reduced to a semantic graph pattern with explicit guards and a focused ONNX
fixture generated with `onnx.helper`.

## Dependency boundaries

Default TFLite conversion and ONNX/TFLite accuracy checking must import neither
TensorFlow nor tf-keras. TensorFlow is allowed only after the user explicitly
requests a TensorFlow-family artifact. PyTorch remains an optional dependency
and is loaded only for a requested PyTorch-family artifact.

No new third-party dependency may be added for this refactor. Use `uv sync` for
the core profile, `uv sync --extra torch` for PyTorch exports, and
`uv sync --extra tensorflow` for optional TensorFlow exports.

## Regression workflow

Create the local corpus inventory without copying model files into Git:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_corpus_manifest \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_corpus.json
```

Run inference sequentially by node tier. For example, Tier 1 is:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_bulk_runner \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_bulk_report_tier1 \
  --min_nodes 50 --max_nodes 199 --tflite_only --root_only
```

Use the fixed order Tier 0 through Tier 5. Do not introduce a process pool or
parallel model runner. Every successful baseline model must remain successful;
accuracy reports must retain their existing stricter judgement and every
comparable float output must remain below a maximum absolute error of `1e-1`.

### Recorded Tier 0 baseline

The recursive Tier 0 corpus at commit `c4f3b7a` contains 190 models. Its
managed result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier0_c4f3b7a.json`:
137 passed, 10 conversion errors, 1 timeout, 6 accuracy failures, and 36
missing accuracy reports. The median per-model duration was 2.165 seconds.
Failures are fixed by normalized signature; local run artifacts remain outside Git.
