# flatbuffer_direct architecture

`flatbuffer_direct` keeps its public CLI and Python API in `onnx2tf.onnx2tf`.
New implementation work belongs behind the internal contracts in
`onnx2tf.tflite_builder.core`; those contracts must not be exported as public
API.

## Pipeline

The required stage order is:

1. normalize the public arguments into `ConversionRequest` and `ArtifactPlan`;
2. preprocess ONNX;
3. create one `ConversionSession`, `GraphIndex`, and `LayoutState`;
4. execute registered passes in `PassPhase` order;
5. lower operators into ModelIR;
6. validate ModelIR invariants;
7. invoke only exporters selected by `ArtifactPlan`;
8. adapt `ConversionResult` back to the legacy return dictionary.

A pass has a stable ID, phase, priority, maximum iteration count, and explicit
`changed` result. Repeating passes must use a graph fingerprint so a cycle
terminates deterministically. Risky rewrites use the transactional mode and
must leave the graph unchanged when invariant validation fails.

Operator additions keep capability validation and lowering in the same
op-family module. Do not add model-name checks. A model-specific failure should
be reduced to a semantic graph pattern with explicit guards and a focused ONNX
fixture generated with `onnx.helper`.

## Dependency boundaries

Default TFLite conversion and ONNX/TFLite accuracy checking must import neither
TensorFlow nor tf-keras. TensorFlow is allowed only after the user explicitly
requests a TensorFlow-family artifact. PyTorch remains an optional dependency
and is loaded only for a requested PyTorch-family artifact.

No new third-party dependency may be added for this refactor. Use `uv sync` for
the core profile, `uv sync --extra torch` for PyTorch exports, and
`uv sync --extra tensorflow` for optional TensorFlow exports.

PyTorch-family example-input construction and export metadata persistence live
in `pytorch_export_support.py`; shared export exceptions live in
`pytorch_export_errors.py`. These modules are bounded internal contracts and
must not import TensorFlow. Image trace data is resized with the existing
PyTorch dependency so TorchScript, Dynamo ONNX, and ExportedProgram generation
does not require the TensorFlow optional extra.

## Regression workflow

Create the local corpus inventory without copying model files into Git:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_corpus_manifest \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_corpus.json
```

Run inference sequentially by node tier. For example, Tier 1 is:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_bulk_runner \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_bulk_report_tier1 \
  --min_nodes 50 --max_nodes 199 --tflite_only --root_only
```

The number `2,000` in the validation policy refers to the number of ONNX graph
nodes (operations) in a model. It is not a source-file line limit. Source and
test modules may be split when that improves ownership or reviewability, but
there is no 2,000-line structural gate.

The active improvement and regression scope is every root model in Tier 0
through Tier 4, including models whose baseline classification is a conversion
error, accuracy failure, or missing report. Recorded timeout models are kept
for provenance but excluded from subsequent runs. Tier 5 is a historical
baseline only and must not be run as part of ongoing refactoring.
Do not introduce a process pool or parallel model runner. Every successful
baseline model must remain successful; known Tier 0-4 failures are improvement
targets and must retain a normalized signature until they improve. Accuracy
reports retain their existing stricter judgement and every comparable float
output must remain below a maximum absolute error of `1e-1`.

Use the managed Tier 0-4 profile for a full active regression:

```bash
uv run python -m onnx2tf.utils.flatbuffer_direct_bulk_runner \
  --root_dir . -o flatbuffer_direct_active_regression \
  --regression_profile docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_active_tier0_4.json \
  --tflite_only
```

The profile fixes root-only discovery, the 1–1,999 node range, all 420 managed
historical model records, and inference concurrency of one. Models classified
as `timeout` in the current managed baseline remain recorded for provenance but
are automatically excluded from subsequent runs. The active run therefore
contains 394 models: 343 expected passes and 51 expected non-passes, excluding
26 recorded timeouts. Tier 5 models cannot be added because the profile loader
rejects tiers above 4 and node ranges above 1,999.

`silero_vad.onnx` is validated with `-kat input state sr` and has a recorded
float32 maximum absolute error of `1.3750978e-6`. The similarly named dynamic
`silero_vad (1).onnx` remains a non-pass input-model defect: it references 14
lexically captured tensors that do not exist in the serialized ONNX, including
all four LSTM weight/bias captures. It cannot provide an ONNX reference result
for an accuracy-preserving promotion.

`inverse_11.onnx` also remains an active non-pass, with the normalized reason
`unsupported_exact_inverse_matrix_size_224`. Stock TFLite has matrix-diagonal
and batch-matmul operators but no matrix solve/inverse operator. The model asks
for three 224x224 inverses after bilinear upsampling. With the fixed evaluation
seed, the matrices have condition numbers from approximately `8.0e9` to
`9.2e10`, and ONNX Runtime produces magnitudes up to approximately `8.3e7`.
Even a float64 NumPy inverse rounded to float32 differs from the ONNX Runtime
reference by `1.7e7` to `1.2e8`, so substituting a different approximate
algorithm cannot satisfy the required `1e-1` absolute-error limit. The existing
custom-op fallback is retained; no inaccurate builtin approximation is emitted.

`string_normalizer_11.onnx` remains an active non-pass with the normalized
reason `unsupported_stock_tflite_string_normalizer`. It requires runtime string
case conversion, locale-aware comparison, and stopword filtering. Stock TFLite
supports string tensors and hash tables but has no string normalization,
case-folding, tokenization, or filtering builtin, so the existing
`ONNX_STRINGNORMALIZER` custom fallback is the only semantics-preserving
artifact. The reference model additionally requests the `en_US` locale, which
is not installed in the core validation environment. No locale package or
string-processing dependency is added by this project.

### Recorded Tier 0 baseline

The recursive Tier 0 corpus at commit `c4f3b7a` contains 190 models. Its
managed result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier0_c4f3b7a.json`:
137 passed, 10 conversion errors, 1 timeout, 6 accuracy failures, and 36
missing accuracy reports. The median per-model duration was 2.165 seconds.
Failures are fixed by normalized signature; local run artifacts remain outside Git.

The formal root-only Tier 0 gate at commit `32c3277` contains 120 readable
models; the planned 121st entry has no readable node count. The managed result
is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier0_root_32c3277.json`: 96 passed, 9
conversion errors, 4 accuracy failures, 11 missing reports, and no timeouts.
Its median duration was 2.281 seconds. All 120 classifications and normalized
signatures match the same models in the recursive baseline.

The root-only Tier 1 gate at commit `a1fd301` contains 86 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier1_root_a1fd301.json`: 57
passed, 5 conversion errors, 13 accuracy failures, 11 missing reports, and
no timeouts. Median and maximum durations were 4.046 and 79.296 seconds.

`ssd_mobilenet_v1_12-int8.onnx` remains an active Tier 1 non-pass with the
normalized reason `invalid_onnx_missing_loop_captures_186`. Conversion succeeds
when its dynamic NHWC input is fixed to `inputs:1,300,300,3` and preserved with
`-kat inputs`, but the source model itself fails both the ONNX checker and ONNX
Runtime validation. Its two `Loop` bodies reference 186 unique tensors that
are neither defined locally nor available from the parent graph. These include
the preprocessor loop increment and numerous postprocessor slice bounds,
thresholds, and other constants. Supplying only the evident `int32(1)` loop
increment exposes the next missing capture immediately. Reconstructing all
missing values heuristically would not provide a trustworthy ONNX reference,
so the generated TFLite artifact is not promoted without the required
accuracy comparison.

`efficientnet-lite4-11-int8.onnx` remains an active Tier 1 accuracy non-pass
with the normalized reason
`onnxruntime_u8s8_saturating_pair_accumulation`. Its input Transpose and
QuantizeLinear outputs match exactly, while the first QLinearConv is the first
divergent tensor. The model combines UINT8 activations with INT8 weights. On
the validation host, ONNX Runtime's CPU kernel performs saturating signed
16-bit pair accumulation for this U8S8 path, whereas the direct TFLite
compatibility lowering computes the mathematical integer convolution before
requantization. A minimal 520-channel reproduction using activation `255` and
weight `-127` yields mathematical accumulator output `129`, but ONNX Runtime
returns `212`, consistent with clipping each two-product sum to `-32768` before
the final accumulation. Emulating that host-specific SIMD behavior with a
large expanded graph would degrade portability and pipeline efficiency, so no
such approximation is emitted. The fixed-seed final output remains below the
required `1e-1` maximum absolute-error ceiling, but it stays a non-pass because
the stricter cosine-similarity gate is not satisfied.

`version-RFB-320-int8.onnx` exhibits the same host-runtime U8S8 limitation and
uses the same normalized reason. The input QuantizeLinear result matches
exactly. For the immediately following QLinearConv, the direct TFLite result
and ONNX ReferenceEvaluator differ at only one of 307,200 elements by one
quantum, while ONNX Runtime CPU and the reference differ at 97,431 elements by
as much as 32 quanta. The current fixed-seed final maximum absolute error is
`0.14972958900034428`, improved from `0.15208351612091064` but still above the
required `1e-1` ceiling. A full ReferenceEvaluator run is not a practical
fallback: ONNX lacks built-in implementations for this model's QLinearConcat
and opset-12 DequantizeLinear, and even with local diagnostic implementations
the sequential run remained inside the pure-NumPy QLinearConv loop after more
than 90 seconds. No host-SIMD emulation or slow evaluator substitution is added
to the production pipeline.

`text_recognition_CRNN_CN_2021nov_int8.onnx` now executes through both
bidirectional LSTMs. Its second LSTM is preceded by a runtime Reshape with the
ONNX target `[0, 0, -1]`. Stale metadata previously described the result as
`[1,1,1]`, although the upstream tensor is `[25,1,2,256]` and the LSTM weights
require an input width of 512. This produced a 6,400-to-256 element Reshape
failure after the LSTM. The centralized shape reconciliation pass now resolves
that contract to `[25,1,512]` from the source tensor and the LSTM input-weight
shape, then propagates the sequence length through the bidirectional output.
The normal sequential `-cotof` path consequently completes and emits its
reports. The model remains an active accuracy non-pass with the normalized
reason `qlinear_matmul_single_quantum_outlier`: both LSTMs are within
`6.7e-6`, while the final QLinearMatMul has one-quantum maximum error that
propagates to a final maximum absolute error of `0.14842605590820312`. Mean
absolute error is `1.3509051097190739e-5`, RMSE is
`0.0011565761101850747`, and cosine similarity is
`0.9999999968466379`.

`fcn-resnet50-12-int8.onnx` is the third Tier 1 model with the normalized
`onnxruntime_u8s8_saturating_pair_accumulation` reason. Its input quantization
and shape operations match, and the first difference appears at the first
UINT8-activation/INT8-weight QLinearConv. With a fixed 224x224 diagnostic
shape, ONNX Runtime CPU and ONNX ReferenceEvaluator differ at 46,743 of
802,816 elements by up to 36 quanta, while the direct TFLite tensor matches
the reference at all 802,816 elements. Under the unchanged managed dynamic
input conditions, the fixed-seed final maximum absolute error has improved
from `1.5115007311105728` to `0.5471203327178955`, but it remains above the
required ceiling and therefore stays an active non-pass.

The root-only Tier 2 gate at commit `ad1d508` contains 113 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier2_root_ad1d508.json`: 80
passed, 4 conversion errors, 3 timeouts, 6 accuracy failures, and 20 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 7.124 and 120.360 seconds.

`yolox_nano.onnx` remains an active Tier 2 non-pass with the normalized reason
`float_conv_accumulation_amplified_by_exp_stride`. The normal sequential
comparison satisfies the aggregate metric gate with mean absolute error
`1.3679266313265127e-5`, RMSE `0.0003010161768765817`, and cosine similarity
`0.9999999999699016`. However, ordinary FLOAT32 convolution accumulation-order
differences reach approximately `0.0021` in the regression head, then the
decoded size path amplifies them through Exp (approximately `0.0085`) and its
stride multiplication to a final maximum absolute error of
`0.1362457275390625`. This exceeds the project's independent `1e-1` ceiling,
so the model is not promoted despite the aggregate evaluator result.

`alike_l_opset11_192x320_post.onnx` remains active with the normalized reason
`topk_index_instability_from_float_ties`. Both previous-frame matching outputs
are exact. In the new-keypoint path, the TopK values differ by at most
`1.8298625946044922e-5`, but near-tied scores select or order different indices.
That turns into an index difference up to 59,908 and a decoded coordinate
difference up to `290.0000057220459`. Of the 5,000 returned keypoints, 4,955
coordinates are common as sets and many raw-order differences are adjacent
pair swaps; the associated descriptors move with those indices. Rounding the
scores before TopK would alter the source model's selection semantics, so the
converter does not add such a model-specific stabilization rule.

The root-only Tier 3 gate at commit `c838b42` contains 71 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier3_root_c838b42.json`: 22
passed, 15 conversion errors, 17 timeouts, 1 accuracy failure, and 16 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 17.248 and 120.662 seconds.

The root-only Tier 4 gate at commit `0a8ee88` contains 30 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier4_root_0a8ee88.json`: 12
passed, 7 conversion errors, 4 timeouts, 2 accuracy failures, and 5 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 28.100 and 121.826 seconds. All 12
passing models remained below the required `1e-1` maximum absolute error.

The root-only Tier 5 gate at commit `95aa61b` contains 34 models. The managed
result is `docs/baselines/flatbuffer_direct_tier5_root_95aa61b.json`: 6
passed, 4 conversion errors, 10 timeouts, 2 accuracy failures, and 12 missing
reports. Median and maximum durations were 51.621 and 123.486 seconds. All 6
passing models remained below the required `1e-1` maximum absolute error; the
largest passing error was `2.3543834686279297e-4`.

The Tier 4 result is part of the active improvement gate. The Tier 5 result is
retained only as historical evidence; do not rerun Tier 5 or use its failed
models as current improvement gates.

## Remaining refactoring order

1. Improve Tier 0-4 layout, transpose, broadcast, shape reconciliation, and
   fusion failures using semantic passes and focused ONNX fixtures.
2. Continue moving validation, capability selection, and lowering into
   op-family modules while preserving the current public API and artifacts.
3. Complete quantization, split/crop, custom/pseudo op, report, and requested-
   artifact-only regression coverage on the validated ModelIR contract.
4. Complete the shared PyTorch/TorchScript/Dynamo ONNX/ExportedProgram
   canonicalization and emitter separation.
5. Measure warm-run conversion time and peak RSS on the active Tier 0-4 set,
   then document improvements and remaining normalized failures.
