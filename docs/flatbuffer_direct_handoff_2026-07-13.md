# flatbuffer_direct refactor handoff — 2026-07-13

## Pause checkpoint

- Branch: `fb-refactor3`
- Latest implementation checkpoint: `a872774` (`index terminal mean layout pass`)
- Remote: `origin/fb-refactor3` contains `a872774`
- Pull request: none; do not create one on resume
- The final handoff commit contains documentation only. After it is pushed,
  the expected working-tree state is clean and local/remote divergence is
  `0 0`.

## Completed work

This resumed interval completed three adjacent semantic layout families using
the staged characterization → mechanical extraction → indexed runner process.

1. Mean layout
   - Characterized the long Mean/Mul/Reshape/Add/Conv success path and Mean
     fan-out rejection in `c99418a`.
   - Moved both Mean layout matchers to `passes/mean_layout.py` in `efb15cd`.
   - Added differential graph-index/layout-state mutation and stable ordered
     runners in `06a9dbd`.
2. LayerNorm statistics layout
   - Characterized pre-Transpose removal, existing post-Transpose reuse, and
     centered-value fan-out rejection in `d7866d2`.
   - Moved both matchers to `passes/layernorm_layout.py` in `267126a`.
   - Replaced both adjacent raw call pairs with one shared-state two-spec
     runner in `bffde62`.
3. Terminal unary/Mean layout
   - Characterized shared-pre retention, unary fan-out rejection, and
     inverse-Transpose-tail deferral in `8bce913`.
   - Moved the complete matcher to `passes/terminal_mean_layout.py` with an
     identical AST in `92446d7`.
   - Added stable runner `layout.terminal_unary_mean_reshape`, differential
     indexing, indexed preconditions, layout synchronization, and all six
     production runner calls in `a872774`.

For all three families, compatibility wrappers remain in
`lower_from_onnx2tf.py`. The extracted indexed implementations contain no
whole-graph producer/consumer map construction and no direct operator-list
insertion/deletion. No dependency or TensorFlow import path was added.

The 2,000 threshold is only the Tier 5 ONNX node-count boundary. It is not a
source-file line limit and no source-line gate should be introduced.

## Unfinished work

The overall Goal is not complete. In particular:

- Continue staged extraction/indexing of the remaining legacy layout rules.
  The next adjacent family is EfficientNet-style SE propagation:
  `_optimize_transpose_se_conv_mul_prepost_nhwc_chains` (482 lines, six call
  positions) and `_optimize_transpose_se_fc_mul_prepost_nhwc_chains` (977
  lines, nine call positions).
- Complete the remaining central lowerer/registry decomposition and consolidate
  op-family validation, capability selection, and lowering.
- Reconnect and exhaustively validate quantization, split/crop, custom/pseudo
  ops, weights, and requested-artifact-only execution on the fixed ModelIR
  contract.
- Complete the planned PyTorch, TorchScript, Dynamo ONNX, and ExportedProgram
  exporter decomposition.
- Run the fixed corpus gates sequentially through Tier 0–Tier 5. Tier 5 means
  models with at least 2,000 ONNX nodes and remains a late-stage gate.
- Complete the artifact matrix, optional TensorFlow exporter compatibility,
  full public CLI/Python contract audit, and final baseline/failure-signature
  comparison.
- Measure three-run median conversion time and peak RSS by tier, enforce the
  +10% non-regression limit, and evaluate the Tier 4 15% speedup target.
- Produce the final requirement-by-requirement completion audit and developer
  documentation. Do not mark the Goal complete until every original plan item
  has direct evidence.

## Branch and changed files

Current branch is `fb-refactor3`. Implementation checkpoint `a872774` changed:

- `docs/flatbuffer_direct_architecture.md`
- `docs/flatbuffer_direct_handoff_2026-07-12.md`
- `onnx2tf/tflite_builder/lower_from_onnx2tf.py`
- `onnx2tf/tflite_builder/passes/terminal_mean_layout.py`
- `tests/test_flatbuffer_direct_architecture.py`
- `tests/test_flatbuffer_direct_pass_efficiency.py`
- `tests/test_flatbuffer_direct_terminal_mean_layout.py`

The final handoff checkpoint additionally corrects the chronological placement
of the indexed terminal Mean section in the 2026-07-12 handoff and adds this
file. No implementation file remains uncommitted after that checkpoint.

## Tests executed

All commands ran in the existing `uv` environment. Inference was strictly
sequential with only one model/process active at a time.

- Terminal Mean characterization plus legacy tests: `5 passed`.
- Terminal Mean extraction/ownership focus: `6 passed`.
- Terminal Mean indexed runner, architecture, and efficiency focus:
  `40 passed`.
- Full direct selection after mechanical extraction:
  `1167 passed, 5 deselected, 2 warnings in 151.84s`.
- Tier 1 `superpoint.onnx`, sequential
  `-tb flatbuffer_direct -cotof` after indexed migration:
  `evaluation_pass=true`, `max_abs=1.6666017472743988e-06`,
  `rmse=1.6207873294228388e-07`, cosine similarity `1.0`.
- Full direct selection after indexed migration:
  `1170 passed, 5 deselected, 2 warnings in 162.39s`.

The full direct command intentionally deselected the same five
optional/environment-sensitive cases used by the established gate:

- `test_tflite_backend_matrix_add`
- `test_tflite_backend_matrix_hardswish_rewrite_on_off`
- `test_tf_converter_resize_cubic_avoids_flex_resize_bicubic`
- `test_tf_converter_resize_cubic_honors_cubic_coeff_a`
- `test_flatbuffer_direct_group_norm_alias_builtin_conversion`

## Failing tests and known issues

- No newly failing test is known at this checkpoint.
- The two full-suite warnings are the established FLOAT16 overflow warnings in
  `ir.py` from ArgMax/ReduceMax and negative-infinity Where coverage.
- The five tests listed above remain explicitly outside the current core gate;
  they were not silently treated as passes.
- A full Tier 0–Tier 5 corpus run has not been performed after this checkpoint,
  so corpus-wide non-regression is not yet proven.
- Performance/RSS targets are not yet proven for the current architecture.
- Baseline-invalid `vit_h_encoder.onnx` remains classified as `invalid_onnx`.
- Per user direction, DEIM is considered a successful conversion family.

## First work on resume

1. Verify `git status --short --branch`, local/remote divergence, and the two
   latest commits; do not create a pull request.
2. Audit the 482-line SE-Conv and 977-line SE-FC rules together, including all
   six/nine production positions and existing positive fixtures.
3. Add compact no-op characterization for the most important shared-input,
   gate fan-out, public-boundary, and optional Mean variants before moving any
   implementation.
4. Commit and push characterization separately, then perform mechanical
   extraction with AST equivalence before introducing indexed mutation.

Resume constraints remain: commit and push at coherent checkpoints only; no
pull request; no new dependency; default direct TFLite and `-cotof` must remain
TensorFlow-free; use `uv`; and run inference validation sequentially with one
process.

## Resumed SE layout checkpoint

Checkpoint `5f5de07` added a dedicated compact SE corpus without duplicating
the large legacy fixtures. It fixes three important boundaries: an SE-Conv
gate with an additional consumer rejects unchanged, a public SE-FC gate
rejects unchanged, and an SE-FC target branch sharing its leading NCHW adapter
rewrites while retaining that adapter for the side branch. Together with the
six existing success variants, focused characterization passed 9 tests.

The complete `_optimize_transpose_se_conv_mul_prepost_nhwc_chains` and
`_optimize_transpose_se_fc_mul_prepost_nhwc_chains` implementations then moved
mechanically to `passes/se_layout.py`. Their ASTs, including docstrings, match
`5f5de07`. The lowerer retains signature-compatible wrappers; all six SE-Conv
and nine SE-FC production positions remain unchanged until the separate
indexed migration checkpoint. An architecture test fixes the single-owner
boundary.

Focused success, rejection, and ownership validation passed 10 tests. The
complete sequential direct selection passed:

```text
1174 passed, 5 deselected, 2 warnings in 149.62s
```

No dependency or TensorFlow path was added, and no inference process was run
concurrently. Next work is the GraphIndex/ordered-runner migration of this
extracted family.
